### Progress
#### 11/30/2019
  set up project on github and cloned repo down to Learn ide to get started.  
  spec.md loaded as per instructions.
#### 12/01/2019
  files today: app/controllers  config.ru  Rakefile   Gemfile
  established framework for controllers.  
  Reviewed MVC ideas and got the idea of MVC relations concerning  multiple models/controllers/views  
  figured out, I think.
#### 12/02/2019
  files today: application_controller completed(maybe).  
  models built.  Views spaceholders laid out.  /index stubbed.  
  layout.erb written.  
  No testing today - I still need to build tables and database.
#### 12/05/2019  
  today's issue was migrating the tables.  I couldn't get rake  
  db:migrate to work today.  I added a database.yml file to the
  config file and chased down some typos.  
  Finally, the migration worked!  I went through every file  
  today and rebuilt several files.
#### 12/08/2019
  rebuilt framework using corneal gem.  Too many issues with db.
#### 12/09/2019
  finished coding the project.  now it's testing, fixing typos,  
  and working on the css to make it look pretty.
#### 12/12/2019
  after a coupple busy days, progress was made this evening.  Background
  image was added, pilgrim image added to layout and debugged.  Some  
  navigation in the CRUD MVC was established.
